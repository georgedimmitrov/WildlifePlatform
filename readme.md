### Wildlife Platform
This is a Wiki like Node.js application where admin can insert/delete/edit content about wildlife and users can look at save("heart") their favourite articles for easy access. The project was initially developed as a course work for university.

### Sample Data

To load sample data, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run sample
```

To wipe data use:

```bash
npm run deletesample
```

That will populate 15 animals with 1 author (admin account) and 2 registered users that can 'like' articles. The logins for the authors are as follows:

|Name|Email (login)|Password|
|---|---|---|
|Admin Account|admin@abv.bg|admin|
|User Account|user@abv.bg|user|
|Peter Georgiev|pesho@abv.bg|pesho|
